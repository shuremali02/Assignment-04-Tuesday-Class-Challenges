# Problem Statement
# Prompt the user to enter the lengths of each side of a triangle and then calculate and print the perimeter of the triangle (the sum of all of the side lengths).

# Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):

# What is the length of side 1? 3

# What is the length of side 2? 4

# What is the length of side 3? 5.5

# The perimeter of the triangle is 12.5

def main():
    side1 : float = float(input("What is the length of side 1? "))
    side2 : float = float(input("What is the length of side 2? "))
    side3 : float = float(input("What is the length of side 3? "))
    sum = side1 + side2 + side3
    print("The perimeter of triangle is " + str(sum))
main()
