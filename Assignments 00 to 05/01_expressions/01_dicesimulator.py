# Problem Statement
# Simulate rolling two dice, three times. Prints the results of each die roll. This program is used to show how variable scope works.

# solution 
import random 
num_sides=6
def roll_dice():
    die1 : int =random.randint(1,num_sides)
    die2 : int =random.randint(1,num_sides)
    total :int =die1 + die2
    print("Total of two dice" ,total)

def main():
    die1 : int = 10
    print("die1 in main() starts as: " + str(die1))   

    roll_dice()
    roll_dice()
    roll_dice()

    print("die1 in main() is: " + str(die1))
main()
